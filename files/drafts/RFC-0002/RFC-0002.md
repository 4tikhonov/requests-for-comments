# RFC-0002: RFC on RFCs Tree

## Motivation

The process for writing RFCs needs a long-term planning instruments in order for writers to get a constantly updated version not only of past RFC but also of future planned ones. The **RFCs Tree** as described in this RFC aims at providing an up-to-date description of the planned RFCs with a short textual summary or each of them, including their dependencies with other RFCs. 

## Definition

**RFCs Tree** is the metaphorical description and the hierarchical representation of the **TM Request for Comments** development plan that will be used as a baseline scenario to help monitoring the achievement of **TM Horizon** over the 10 years to come. 

## Behavior 

While **RFCs Tree** is itself resulting from the progressive completion of RFCs through time, **RFCs Tree** also acts as a blueprint defining the incremental steps to the building of the Time Machine Horizon/Infrastructure. 

**RFCs Tree** then behaves as a body of law gathering the whole RFC documentation and production process, and as a progress indicator informing of the upgrade the of the Time Machine components in real time. 

**RFCs Tree** is a macro-architecture plan that shapes dependencies between RFCs. It could be divided into micro thematic or productive arcs as each RFC belongs to specific sequence and is classified in one of the following categories: Framework, Infrastructure, Data, LTM. 

Singular RFCs are the basic units of **RFCs Tree**. The +70 initial RFCs are listed at the end of this document. This initial set is an indicative path to complete the TM Horizon and could be modified/edited if needed.
The tree-like structure -and the subsequent dependencies chains which connect singular RFC- guarantees that TM Horizon would be realised as each RFC edit/removal/addition will cause dynamic adjustements and reorganisations.

RFCs Tree should be updated and consulted in real time on TM website.

Standard themselves may come and  go, but the open way of establishing them and negotiating them should  persist. |                                                              |
| *RFC-0001* |                      RFC on TM Glossary                      | Reaching consensus on the technology options to follow in a programme as large as Time Machine is a complex issue. To ensure the open development and evaluation of work, a process inspired by the Request for Comments (RFC) that was used for the development of the Internet protocol1 will be adapted to the needs of Time Machine. Time Machine Requests for Comments will be freely accessible publications, identified with a unique ID, constituting the main process for establishing rules, recommendations, core architectural choices for the Time Machine components. |                          RFC on RFC                          |

The RFCs Tree as described in this RFC aims at providing an up-to-date description of the planned RFCs with a short textual summary or each of them, including their dependencies with other RFCs. |                          RFC on RFC                          |
| *RFC-0003* |               RFC on RFC Editiorial committee                | In order to bootstrap the  process, a small group will be created, the TM RFC committee. This RFC  defines the process for this election and renewal rules |  RFC on RFC, RFC on RFCs Tree,  RFC on Publication Platform  |
| *RFC-0004* |                 RFC on Publication Platform                  | It will be crucial to decide on  the technology and platform for managing the publication process of RFC.

| *RFC-0005* |                          RFC on LTM                          | In order to build a planetary scale Time Machine, it is necessary to define an organic incremental strategy. To succeed, the Time Machine must enable to progressively anchor itself in local territories, directly bringing locally higher value to the activities, favouring the creation of new projects to mine information about the past in surviving objects and documents. Local Time Machines can be defined as zones of higher density of activities of past reconstruction. This RFC defines the dynamics that permit to bootstrap Local Time Machines, facilitate onboarding of new projects, valorise the data extracted, facilitate the involvement of the local population, develop use cases for exploitation avenues and eventually find sustainable regime where Big Data of the Past are fruitfully exploited leading to a constant increase of such activities. | RFC on RFC, RFC on TM Glossary,  RFC on Technical Charter, RFC on Vision Mission and Value Charter |
| Planned 2020 |                   RFC on Technical Charter                   | The goal of the Charter is to  guarantee a first level of standardisation for data and processes, in order  to remain light and useable by the most, the charter also encourages the use  of universal and open interfaces and references that do not need central  coordination |                                                              |
| Planned 2020 |           RFC on Vision Mission and Values  Charter           | In order to protect overarching  purpose, fundamental values and ethical principles, a common Charter will be  created. Its duty will be to protect the core of the TM and sustain its  future. Becoming a TM network member implies to ratify the Vision, mission  and values Charter |                                                              |
| Planned 2020 |        RFC on Intellectual property rights and licenses       | Defining licenses to preserve  intellectual property rights (regulating data acquisition, sharing and  publishing) and sustain the interoperability and accessibility of the TM. The  proposed solutions could be based on the Creative Commons copyright licenses  and should be further developed with the help of cultural-heritage network  (e.g. Europeana), used to tackle such issues and already proposing solutions.  Means of monitoring the openness process of data should also be taken into  concern. | RFC on Technical Charter, RFC on  Vision Mission and Value Charter |
| Planned 2020 |                        RFC on Training                        | Complying with the TM Rules and  Recommendations and the legal settings, using the TM components and  understanding TM infrastructures, will require specific trainings. A proper  set of documentation, tutorials, videos, online courses will be offered o the  partners. This RFC will set the general rules for building training  materials. These principles will be later used by other more specific RFC on  training |      RFC on Intellectual property  rights and licenses       |
| Planned 2020 |                    RFC on LTM Value Scale                    | The proposed LTM’s value scale  (Key concepts and global overview – Local Time Machines), based on density  criteria, will be discussed and its relevance and organisation further  developed. Value scale concerning PWTMLs will be created based on the already  defined bricks and other criteria need to be proposed in order to foster the  development of PWTMLs (e.g. collaboration, cooperation metrics). As some of  the measure will relate to qualitative process, a dedicated TM RFC on  collaboration indicators, will focus on creating a suitable metrics system.  The labelling system might require a third-party certification to assess its  efficiency and respect. |                          RFC on LTM                          |
| Planned 2020 |                      RFC on LTM Training                      | Specific RFC rooted on the  general principle established by RFC on training but adapted to the framework  developed in the RFC on LTM. |                 RFC on LTM, RFC on Training                  |
| Planned 2020 |  RFC on Definition of typologies  of digitisation interventions | A typology of digitisation  interventions will be established, separating a.   collections that can be moved and  processed in digital hubs (large, non-fragile collections), collections or  objects that need local intervention (e.g. very fragile document, statues,  buildings), b.   process that can be  performed by volunteers using mobile technology (e.g. scanning campaign  across cities, on-the-fly digitisation in reading rooms), processes that can  be performed using robots and drones, etc. |                                                              |
| Planned 2020 |            RFC on standardisation and  homologation           | Definition of the terms and  contracts enabling digitisation partners to become part of the Time Machine  network. | RFC on Definition of typologies  of digitisation interventions |
| Planned 2020 |     RFC on Digitisation Priorities  and Data Selection      | A Data selection model based on  the identification of performance criterion, will help partners focus on  those aspects and take according decisions. The National Information  Standards Organisation (NISO) also proposed a Framework for guidance for  Building Good Digital Collections. Example of performance criterion:  Significance of Content to Internal Stakeholders (degree to which a  collection, once digitised supports the immediate and long-term research and  teaching needs of the institution), Significance of Content to External  Stakeholders (a highly successful digital collection is of interest to  researchers and users outside of the university), Uniqueness (many unique  institutional resources such as original photographs, archival materials,  grey literature such as university technical reports and conference  proceedings remain to be digitised), Exposure (degree to which the digital  collection garners the institution positive recognition and press and  assesses the potential for the digital availability of the collection to  result in grants and other funding). This Digitation recommandation will also  be in line with the LTM coordinated strategy for digitisation. | RFC on Definition of typologies  of digitisation interventions |
| Planned 2020 |                      RFC on Open Hardware                     | Definition of the open hardware  strategy for Time Machine including licensing terms, catalogues, | RFC on Definition of typologies  of digitisation interventions |
| Planned 2021 |                    RFC on data lifecycle                     | The data lifecycle within the TM  starts with the concept of documents and data selection. The goal is to help  partners select proper documents or collections to be processed by the TM  pipelines and then the data within the documents. The data selection is  closely related to the LTM or PWTML’s perimeters (see LTM/Framework) and  should be stated prior to any projects launch. Criteria such as intellectual  property rights, obtaining copyright permissions, digitisations, OCR  processing or metadata creation costs are also to be taken into concern. Extending the resulti of the RFC of  Digitisaiton Priorities and Dataselection, the RFC will aso details Data  acquisition, Data sharing and Data publishing | RFC on LTM, RFC on Digitisation  Priorities / Data Selection |
| Planned 2021 |                     RFC on Operation Graph                    | Definition of the format of the  operation graph describing the operation currently pursuded in the TM  consoritum, as monitored by the TMO. It includes both automatic processes and  human interventions. |                    RFC on data lifecycle                     |
| Planned 2021 |                      RFC on TM Data Graph                     | The Time Machine Data Graph  contains all the information modelled in the Time Machine. The graph is  constructed both manually and automatically through the processing of the  Digital Content Processor. The Graph is intrinsically composed of two  subparts (1) The bright graph composed  of information that have been manually mapped and integrated with other large  database or used in a publication. This information is integrated with the  current sum of digital human knowledge. It can be considered actual. (2) The  dark graph composed of information extracted automatically from (massive)  documentation which has been used so far apart as individual historic  items. It can be considered  virtual. |                    RFC on data lifecycle                     |
| Planned 2021 |                        RFC for TM APIs                        | Algorithms and software  integrated into the Time Machine need to be able to communicate with each  other. Thus, a definition of joint APIs is required. It is likely that TM  Services are built on top of REST interfaces. In order to match TM’s needs  these will have to be adapted towards the need of large-scale machine  learning. A probable addition is the option to provide gradient information  of a specific module that is integrated using the API, for example. This way  remote services can also be integrated into large-scale training processes. |                    RFC on Operation Graph                    |
| Planned 2021 |  RFC for classification and  planning of languages to address | Defintion of the multilingual  strategy of the TM. This RFC has impact on the exploitation platforms.The TM  will handle documents in multiple European languages and dialects. Some of  them might be more complicated to address than others due to pre-existing  tools for modern variants or availability of materials. A working plan of NLP  tools development should be conceived by taking the materials, the locations  of the LTMs and the Digitisation Hubs, and the features of the languages into  consideration. |                     RFC on TM Data Graph                     |
| Planned 2021 |                       RFC on Annotation                       | Definition of the annotation  protocols used for the document of TM Data Graph. This RFC will be used by  exploitation platforms |                     RFC on TM Data Graph                     |
| Planned 2021 |   RFC on Digital Content Processor  Development and Testing   | Digital Content Processor are  Automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video,  sound, etc.). the following pipeline  may be envisioned. 1.   Development of a DCP in dedicated  “Sandbox” (a place where trial and errors can be made without compromising  the entire functioning of the Time Machine architecture). Training will be  done on existing labelled documents.   2.   Submission of the DCP to the Time Machine  Organisation dedicated service. 3.   After some  benchmark and assessment of performances acceptation or rejection of the DCP.  The DCP becomes a TM Official Component. | RFC on General Standards for the  Super Computing Architecture , RFC on TM API |
| Planned 2021 |       RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 1      | Digital Content Processor are Automatic processes for extracting information from documents  (images, video, sound, etc.). Digital Content Processor of Level 1 just label  mentions of entities. Each processing  is fully traceable and reversible. The results of the processing constitute  the core dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated in the TM  Data Graph. The document should define: a.   The  technical condition for implementing DCP that can be inserted in the Time  Machine Operation Graph. b.   The requirement for  hosting DCP in an TM Super Computing Infrastructure. The process by which DCP are developed,  tested, labelled, published and puts in operations | RFC of Data Graph, RFC on  Digital Content Processor Development and Testing |
| Planned 2021 |       RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 2      | Digital Content Processor are  Automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video,  sound, etc.). Digital Content Processor of Level 2 label relations between  entities. Each processing is fully  traceable and reversible. The results of the processing constitute the core  dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated in the TM Data Graph.  The document should define: a.   The technical  condition for implementing DCP that can be inserted in the Time Machine  Operation Graph. b.   The requirement for hosting DCP  in an TM Super Computing Infrastructure.   The process by which DCP are developed, tested, labelled, published  and puts in operations |      RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 1      |
| Planned 2021 |       RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 3      | Digital Content Processor are  Automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video,  sound, etc.). Digital Content Processor of Level 3 label Rules. Each  processing is fully traceable and reversible. The results of the processing constitute  the core dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated in the TM  Data Graph. The document should define: a.

The process by which DCP are developed,  tested, labelled, published and puts in operations |      RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 2      |
| Planned 2021 |  RFC on Synergy and interaction in EU Research Infrastructure | The TM digitisation network will  build upon existing EU Research Infrastructures (DARIAH, CLARIN) and  infrastructures providing access to CH (Europeana, Archive Portal Europe,  etc.). TM will introduce new processing pipelines for transforming and  integrating CH data in such infrastructures. |                                                              |
| Planned 2021 |  RFC on General Standards for the  Super Computing Architecture | This document  will define the general rules that the TM Network  partners have to follow to integrate their computing resources in the TM  Super Computing Architecture and the routing processes managing the data  pipelines. This document will particularly define - (a) The software and  hardware standards that the computing resources will follow across the entire  distributed Super Computing Architecture. - (b) The routing protocols of  the TM Operation Graphs. - (c) The processes for naming and  renewing the administrators of the administrators -  (d) The  role of the TMO for managing of the infrastructure. | RFC on Operation Graph, RFC on  Data Graph, RFC on Synergy and interaction in EU Research Infrastructure |
| Planned 2021 |                    RFC on Time Machine Box                    | Also meant to cover storage  needs for data, the Box should help partners involved in a data acquisition,  sharing or publishing process to conform to the metadata specifications and  delivery – harvesting protocols as stated by the data model. One of its goal  is to smooth and contribute to the automatization of the digitisation process  (offering for instance a way of monitoring the digitisation tasks). This  hardware is part of the Time Machine Official Components. The RFC will define how the production of  the Time Machine Box should be manage in the long run |                    RFC on Operation Graph                    |
| Planned 2021 |                    RFC Digitisation Hubs                     | Definition of functionning and  business model fo the Digitsation Hubs. In order for the Digitisation Hubs to  be implemented, standards in terms of resolution, file formats, and metadata  during acquisition need to be defined beforehand (RFC on Technical Charts).  These must be consensual and simple, in order to be easily implemented and to  fit into existing practices. The RFC also needs to evaluate relevant  technologies and recommend affordable technology that does not damage the  objects, providing the best possible results at the same time. We aim to  distribute cheap technology on a large scale using e.g. open design hardware.  More costly and dedicated scan methods such as scan robots and tomographic  methods should be available in dedicated specialized centres spread across  the European Union such that their services are available to a maximum number  of users. The objective of achieving cheap and wide-spread digitisation  should be a priority in this RFC. |        RFC on Open Hardware, RFC on  Time Machine Box        |
| Planned 2022 |                RFC for Named Entity Recognition               | This RFC defines named entity  recognition in older European languages and variants.

| Planned 2023 |               RFC on Enhancing Collaboration                | Investigating how to supports  partnerships across networks members of the Time Machine (e.g. Europeana,  Icarus) or external cultural-heritage networks, and what means would be a  suitable answer. The reflexion should focus on different aspects: how to enhance  collaboration internally and externally both at the level of the LTM and the  TMO (e.g. with other LTM or partner’s networks), how to enhance  best-practices exchanges, share of content and collaboration with already  existing cultural-heritage networks and associations |                          RFC on LTM                          |
| Planned 2023 |                    RFC on Franchise System                    | A franchise model clarifying  financial relations between LTM and TMO’s services will be put in place,  according to the financial needs and costs of the technical and coordination  infrastructures of the TM. The franchise system is meant to be evolving, as  the network will grow along with its reputation in the public’s eye, and the  LTM’s financial benefit generated. This franchise system is meant to be  complementary to the one established for the TMO partners. To enter an LTM an  institution should at least become a member of the TMO. One of the subtasks  of this RFC is also to assess and further design the role of the TMO as a  “Finance, Economic, Intelligence and Watch services office |                          RFC on LTM                          |

| Planned 2023 |                    RFC on Distributed Storage                  | The TM distributed storage  system will be aimed at offering an alternative solution to current HTTP  based storage. Although in a first  phase, most document and data will be stored on specific servers accessible  through standard protocol (e.g. images on IIIF servers), the aim of the  project is to develop a storage solution that would have the following  objective: 1. Giving access to high volume of data with high efficiency, 2.  Optimising storage to store more data, 3. Implementing long-term preservation  of data, preventing accidental or deliberate data deletion and keeping a  fully versioned history of the data stored, 4. Guarantying authenticity of  the data stored and preventing the inclusion of fake sources. | RFC on Data Graph, RFC on  Operation Graph, RFC on Synergy and interaction in EU Research  Infrastructure, RFC on Time Machine Box |
| Planned 2023 |        RFC on Distributed storage  system for Public Data      | This document will define the  infrastructure principle for a decentralized solution of public datasets  based on Creative Commons licences like CC-0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC and the  Europeana rights declarations. Storage will be done on the resources shared  by the partners of the TM infrastructure alliance. A distributed system like  IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and the work done by the IPFS Consortium  for persistence of IPFS object may be a good starting point. Such kind of  file system do not identity a resource by its location but by a unique  identification number. Routing algorithms optimise through P2P algorithm the  most efficient ways to bring the data to the visualization or computing  processes. This also speed up process  when the host is a region with low connectivity. Redundancy and long-term resilience can be  guaranteed. This means that the system can be designed to make in practice  undeletable any public data content that it starts to store, making it hard  to censor content. For this reason, it  is especially well adapted for public data associated with creative common  licenses. Systems like IPFS also give the possibility for each node of the  network to choose the categories of data they accept to replicate. This gives  some flexibility in the negotiation of common strategy by the Time Machine  Infrastructure Alliance. For ensuring  the authenticity of the data stored, a blockchain type solution could be the  solution. The interaction between the distributed file system and the  authentication solution will be defined by the RFC. |                  RFC on Distributed Storage                  |
| Planned 2023 |      RFC on Distributed Storage System for Private Data      | Private datasets could be stored  either (1) - In specific layer of the  distributed storage system provided reliable cryptographic and authentication  systems are in place, (2) - In “fenced” location otherwise offered by  partners of the Time Machine Network as storage solution. In both cases, the  RFC should define how such closed dataset could use the services of the Time  Machine infrastructure and under which condition |                  RFC on Distributed Storage                  |
| Planned 2023 |                 RFC on On-demand Digitisation                 | This RFC defines the process for  on-demand digitisation enabling any user to ask for the digitisation of a  specific document. A alignment of the archival description system is  necessary. |             RFC on Data Graph, RFC on Operation Graph             |
| Planned 2023 |     RFC on Global optimization of Digitisation Process      | Defiintion of the strategy for  optimizing the digitisation processes. The objective of this RFC is among  others to avoir digitisation of redondant printed material through a  synchronization of all the digitisation initiatives. | REFC on Digitisation Priorities,  RFC on on-demand digitisation, RFC on distributed storage for Public Data,  RFC on Synergy and interaction in EU Research Infrastructure, |

| Planned 2024 |                  RFC on Knowledge Transfer                   | Investigating how to support  achievements and knowledge transfer inside the TM network. Ensuring a global  research collaboration at a European scale. There are rare examples of  large-scale research data management models, dealing with similar complexity level  as the TM, however some guidelines can be found such as: “Guidance Document  Presenting a Framework for Discipline-specific Research Data Management”  (Science Europe, January 2018), “Practical Guide to the International  Alignment of Research Data Management” (Science Europe, November 2018). |               RFC on Enhancing  Collaboration                |
| Planned 2024 |                     RFC on Smart Cluster                     | Defining what would be the rules  to be followed by the future smart clusters (for instance compliance with LTM  rules and recommendations), what means will ensure the creation of such a  space for creativity, support inter-disciplinary exchanges, political  involvement and jobs creation, what relations could be built between the  participants of the smart clusters and the partners of the LTM, how to  monitor, evaluate and revise or update the process. |                          RFC on LTM                          |

| Planned 2024 |             RFC on Large-Scale Inference Engine             | The Large-Scale Inference Engine  is capable of inferring the consequences of chaining any information in the  database. This permits to induce new logical consequences of existing data.  The Large-Scale Inference Engine is used to shape and to assess the coherence  of the 4D simulations based on human-understandable concepts and constraints.  Its origin derives from more traditional logic-based AI technology, slightly  overlooked since the recent success of the deep learning architecture, that  can, nevertheless, play a key role in an initiative like TM. The document  will specify the various kinds of rules that the Large-Scale Inference Engine  can process including - Rules extracted from documents by DCP, - Implicit  Rules made explicit - Rules (statistical or not) induced from the data. The  document should define - the process by which rules are submitted, tested and  integrated in the engine, - the processes for managing conflicting rules or  results from various rules. The document will also motivate implementation  solution in relation with existing deployed systems like Wolfram Alpha or IBM  Watson and standards like OWL, SKOS. |      RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 3      |
| Planned 2024 |                       RFC on the 4D Grid                      | Through a hierarchical division  of space (3D) and time, the system organises a multi-resolution 4D grid which  serves as a general spatiotemporal index. Each “cube” in the grid indexes all  the information relevant for these particular spatiotemporal elements. It  offers an efficient perspective for organising the large datasets and  performing collective curation through manual and automatic processes. Each  element of the grid will also be potentially labelled according to other  various multidimensional criteria, some of them being AI-based descriptors  (e.g. descriptors for architectural style detection in images). |                      RFC on Data Graph                       |
| Planned 2024 |                     RFC on 4D Simulations                     | The 4D grid is sparse as many  places/times in the world that are not directly associated with existent  archival data. A central research challenge is to develop AI-systems capable  of extending the information of the data grid in space and time through continuous  extrapolation and interpolation, and developing new ways of visualizing which  part of the content is anchored in sourced data, simulated or unknown.  Extensions of current deep-learning generative methods, originally developed  for 2D imaging, can be envisioned to deal with the richness of the 4D  datasets. Many 4D simulations can be associated with the same 4D grid and one  central challenge is to manage this multiplicity of worlds and their specific  resolutions level for various services of the Time Machine (e.g.  entertainment, policy planning). |                      RFC on the 4D Grid                      |
| Planned 2024 |               RFC TM Tools for History Research              | To engage researchers in social  sciences and humanities is to productively use the Big Data of the Past, and  the TM can offer researchers a series of tools that facilitate analyses.  These tools will be enhanced by the Digital Content Processor and the Simulation  Engines, which will enable scholars to work with historical data in an  unprecedented way. | RFC on 4D Simulations, RFC on  Large-Scale Inference Engine  |
| Planned 2024 |               RFC on New Scanning Technology                | Cutting-edge technologies, such  as automatic scanning machines with low human supervision, scanning robots  and solutions for scanning films and books without the need to unroll/open  them, should be considered and fostered by the TM. A specific scheme to incentivize  these technologies will be created. The goal is to reach an appropriate mix  of dedicated specialized scanning centres and at the development of mobile  special use hardware, e.g. mobile CT scanners that are mounted on trucks. |       RFC on Open Hardware, RFC on  Digitisation Hubs        |
| Planned 2025 |                      RFC on 4D Simulator                      | The 4D Simulator manages a  continuous spatiotemporal simulation of all possible pasts and futures that  are compatible with the data. the 4D  Simulator includes a multiscale hierarchical architecture for dividing space  and time into discrete volumes with a unique identifier: a simulation engine  for producing new datasets based on the information stored. Each possible  spatiotemporal multiscale simulation corresponds to a multidimensional  representation in the 4D computing infrastructure. When sufficient  spatiotemporal density of data is reached, it can produce a 3D representation  of the place at a chosen moment in European history. In navigating the  representation space, one can also navigate in alternative past and future  simulations. Uncertainty and  incoherence are managed at each stage of the process and directly associated  with the corresponding reconstructions of the past and the future. The document should specify the interaction  of the 4D simulator with the rest of the architecture answering questions  like: - How can an entity of the TM Data Graph be associated to a particular  element of the 4D Grid, - How can 4D simulations be run and cached for future  use, - How can the system be used directly in exploitation platform |                  RFC on the 4D simulations                   |
| Planned 2025 |            RFC on Universal Representation Engine            | The Universal Representation  Engine manages a multidimensional representation space resulting from the  integration of the pattern of extremely diverse types of digital cultural  artefacts (text, images, videos, 3D and time), and permitting new types of data  generation based on transmodal pattern understanding. In such a space, the  surface structure of any complex cultural artefact, landscape or situation is  seen as a point in a multidimensional vector space. On this basis, it could  generate a statue or a building, produce a piece of music or a painting,  based only on its description, geographical origins and age. The document  will specify the integration of the URE in the global architecture, outlining  for example how a give node in the TM Data Graph can be associated with a  parametric representation space. |                       RFC for TM APIs                        |
