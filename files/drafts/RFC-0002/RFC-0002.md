# RFC-0002: RFC on RFCs Tree

## Motivation

The process for writing RFCs needs a long-term planning instruments in order for writers to get a constantly updated version not only of past RFC but also of future planned ones. The **RFCs Tree** as described in this RFC aims at providing an up-to-date description of the planned RFCs with a short textual summary or each of them, including their dependencies with other RFCs. 

## Definition

**RFCs Tree** is the metaphorical description and the hierarchical representation of the **TM Request for Comments** development plan that will be used as a baseline scenario to help monitoring the achievement of **TM Horizon** over the 10 years to come. 

## Behavior 

While **RFCs Tree** is itself resulting from the progressive completion of RFCs through time, **RFCs Tree** also acts as a blueprint defining the incremental steps to the building of the Time Machine Horizon/Infrastructure. 

**RFCs Tree** then behaves as a body of law gathering the whole RFC documentation and production process, and as a progress indicator informing of the upgrade the of the Time Machine components in real time. 

**RFCs Tree** is a macro-architecture plan that shapes dependencies between RFCs. It could be divided into micro thematic or productive arcs as each RFC belongs to specific sequence and is classified in one of the following categories: Framework, Infrastructure, Data, LTM. 

Singular RFCs are the basic units of **RFCs Tree**. The +70 initial RFCs are listed at the end of this document. This initial set is an indicative path to complete the TM Horizon and could be modified/edited if needed.
The tree-like structure -and the subsequent dependencies chains which connect singular RFC- guarantees that TM Horizon would be realised as each RFC edit/removal/addition will cause dynamic adjustements and reorganisations.

RFCs Tree will be consulted in real time on TM website.
