# RFC-0002: RFC on RFC Tree

## Motivation

The process for writing RFCs requires long-term planning instruments which will enable writers to not only access constantly updated versions of current RFCs but also to have a view on future planned RFCs. The **RFC Tree** as described in this RFC will provide an up-to-date description of all planned RFCs, including a short textual motivation for each and listing their dependencies with other RFCs. 

## Definition

**RFC Tree** is the metaphorical description and the hierarchical representation of the **Time Machine Request for Comments** development plan that will be used as a baseline scenario to help monitor the progress and achievements towards completion of the **Time Machine Horizon** over the coming 10 years. 

## Behavior 

While the **RFC Tree** itself results from the progressive completion of RFCs over time, it also acts as a blueprint for defining the incremental steps used to build the Time Machine Infrastructure. 

**RFC Tree** behaves as a body of law for Time Machine, containing all RFC documentation and documenting the production process, as well as a progress indicator showing the progress of upgrades to Time Machine components in real time. 

**RFC Tree** is a macro-architecture plan that shapes dependencies between RFCs. It could be divided into micro thematic or productive arcs, as each RFC belongs to a specific sequence and is classified in one of the following categories: Framework, Infrastructure, Data, Local Time Machines. 

Singular RFCs are the basic units of the **RFC Tree**. The 70+ initial RFCs are listed at the end of this document. This initial set is an indicative path to completion of the **Time Machine Horizon** and may be expanded/modified/edited as needed. The tree-like structure and subsequent dependency chains which connect singular RFC guarantee that the **Time Machine Horizon**  will be realised, as each RFC edit/removal/addition will cause dynamic adjustments and reorganisation.

This RFC provides the most up-to-date version of the **RFC Tree**.

To ensure open development and evaluation of work, a process inspired by the Request for Comments (RFC) that was used for the development of the Internet protocol is being adapted to the needs of Time Machine. Time Machine Requests for Comments are freely accessible publications, identified with a unique ID, that constitute the main process for establishing rules, recommendations and core architectural choices for Time Machine components. |                                                              |
| *RFC-0001* |                      RFC on TM Glossary                      | The Time Machine Glossary's function is to provide clear definitions of the terms used in the RFCs and throughout related Time Machine documentation. It should be updated regularly as new RFCs are introduced and published. |                          RFC on RFCs                          |
| *RFC-0002* |                       RFC on RFC Tree                       | The process for writing RFCs requires long-term planning instruments which will enable writers to not only access constantly updated versions of current RFCs but also to have a view on future planned RFCs. The RFC Tree as described in this RFC will provide an up-to-date description of all planned RFCs, including a short textual motivation for each and listing their dependencies with other RFCs. |                          RFC on RFCs                          |
| *RFC-0003* |                 RFC on Publication Platform                  | This Request for Comments (RFC) describes the inner workings and technical details of the RFC platform itself. It aims to provide the technical framework for authorship, review, community contribution and publication of all future Time Machine RFCs. |  RFC on RFCs, RFC on RFC Tree,  RFC on Editorial Committee |
| *RFC-0003* |               RFC on RFCs Editiorial Committee               | This RFC outlines the basic policies and procedures related to the RFC Editorial Committee, many of which have been inspired by the IEEE Signal Processing Society [^ieee_sps_policy]. The main items that this document defines are: the organisation of the RFC Editorial Committee, how members are appointed, procedure for applications, length of term and main duties. |  RFC on RFCs, RFC on RFC Tree,  RFC on Publication Platform  |
| *RFC-0005* |                          RFC on Local Time Machines                          | In order to build a planetary-scale Time Machine, it is necessary to define an organic incremental strategy. To succeed, the Time Machine must be able to progressively anchor itself in local territories, bringing added value to local activities directly, spurring the creation of new projects to mine information of the past contained in surviving objects and documents. Local Time Machines (LTM) can be defined as zones of higher density of activities towards reconstruction of the past. This RFC defines the dynamics that will: enable bootstrapping of Local Time Machines, facilitate the onboarding of new projects, valorise the data extracted, facilitate the involvement of the local population, develop use cases for exploitation avenues, and eventually enable the development of sustainable structures where Big Data of the Past are fruitfully exploited thus leading to a constant increase of such activities. | RFC on RFCs, RFC on TM Glossary,  RFC on Technical Charter, RFC on Vision Mission and Value Charter |
| Planned 2020 |                   RFC on Technical Charter                   | The goal of the Technical Charter is to guarantee a first level of standardisation for data and processes, in order to remain light and useable by most, and the charter also encourages the use  of universal and open interfaces and references that do not require central coordination |                                                              |
| Planned 2020 |           RFC on Vision Mission and Values Charter           | In order to protect Time Machine's overarching purpose, fundamental values and ethical principles, a common charter will be created. Its duty will be to protect the core of TM and sustain its future. Becoming a TM network member implies ratification of the Vision, Mission and Values Charter |                                                              |
| Planned 2020 |        RFC on Intellectual Property Rights and Licenses       | Defining licenses to preserve intellectual property rights (regulating data acquisition, sharing and  publishing) and to sustain the interoperability and accessibility of the TM. The  proposed solutions could be based on the Creative Commons copyright licenses and should be further developed with the help of cultural-heritage networks (e.g. Europeana) who are experienced with these issues and are already proposing solutions. Means of monitoring the openness process of data should also be taken into consideration. | RFC on Technical Charter, RFC on  Vision Mission and Value Charter |
| Planned 2020 |                        RFC on Training                        | Complying with TM Rules and Recommendations, legal settings, using TM components and understanding TM infrastructures will require specific training. A proper  set of documentation, tutorials, videos and online courses will be offered to partners. This RFC will set the general rules for development of training  materials, and these principles will subsequently be used by other more specific training RFCs |      RFC on Intellectual property  rights and licenses       |
| Planned 2020 |                    RFC on LTM Value Scale                    | The proposed LTM Value Scale (Key concepts and global overview – Local Time Machines), based on density  criteria, will be outlined and its relevance and organisation further developed. Value scales concerning Projects will be created based on previously defined bricks and other criteria required in order to foster the  development of Projects (e.g. collaboration, cooperation metrics). As some of the measures will relate to qualitative processes, a dedicated RFC on collaboration indicators will focus on creating a suitable system of metrics. The labelling system may require a third-party certification to assess its efficiency and accuracy. |                          RFC on LTM                          |
| Planned 2020 |                      RFC on LTM Training                      | Specific RFC rooted in the general principles established by **RFC on Training** but adapted to the framework developed in the **RFC on LTM**. |                 RFC on LTM, RFC on Training                  |
| Planned 2020 |  RFC on Definition of Typologies of Digitisation Interventions | A typology of digitisation interventions will be established grouping: (a) collections that can be moved and processed in digital hubs (large, non-fragile collections), collections or  objects that need local intervention (e.g. very fragile document, statues,  buildings) and (b) process that can be performed by volunteers using mobile technology (e.g. scanning campaign  across cities, on-the-fly digitisation in reading rooms), processes that can  be performed using robots and drones, etc. |                                                              |
| Planned 2020 |            RFC on Standardisation and Homologation           | Definition of the terms and contracts enabling digitisation partners to become part of the Time Machine network. | RFC on Definition of typologies  of digitisation interventions |
| Planned 2020 |     RFC on Digitisation Priorities and Data Selection      | A data selection model based on the identification of performance criteria will help partners to focus on priority aspects and to take decisions accordingly. For reference, the National Information Standards Organisation (NISO) has already proposed a framework for guidance on Building Good Digital Collections. Examples of performance criteria include: Significance of Content to Internal Stakeholders (degree to which a collection, once digitised supports the both immediate and long-term research and the teaching needs of the institution), Significance of Content to External Stakeholders (a highly successful digital collection is of interest to  researchers and users outside of the university), Uniqueness (many unique  institutional resources such as original photographs, archival materials,  grey literature such as university technical reports and conference proceedings have not yet been digitised), Exposure (degree to which a digital collection garners positive recognition and press for an institution and assessing the potential for digital availability of the collection to result in grants and other funding). This digitation recommandation will also  be in line with the LTM coordinated strategy for digitisation. | RFC on Definition of Typologies  of Digitisation Interventions |
| Planned 2020 |                      RFC on Open Hardware                     | Definition of the open hardware strategy for Time Machine including licensing terms and catalogues | RFC on Definition of Typologies  of Digitisation Interventions |
| Planned 2021 |                    RFC on Data Lifecycle                    | The data lifecycle within the TM begins with the concept of documents and data selection. The goal is to assist partners in selecting proper documents or collections to be processed by the TM pipelines and then subsequently which data within the documents. The data selection is closely related to the LTM or project perimeters (see LTM/Framework) and should be stated prior to any project launch. Criteria such as intellectual property rights, obtaining copyright permissions, digitisation, OCR processing or metadata creation costs must also be taken into account. Extending the results of the **RFC of  Digitisation Priorities and Data selection**, the RFC will also detail data acquisition, data sharing and data publishing | RFC on LTM, RFC on Digitisation  Priorities / Data Selection |
| Planned 2021 |                     RFC on Operation Graph                    | Definition of the format of the operation graph describing the operations currently pursued in the TM partners, as monitored by the **Time Machine Organisation**. It includes both automatic processes and  human interventions. |                    RFC on Data Lifecycle                    |
| Planned 2021 |                      RFC on TM Data Graph                     | The Time Machine **Data Graph** contains all information modelled in the Time Machine. The graph is constructed both manually and automatically through the processing of the  **Digital Content Processor**. The **Data Graph** is intrinsically composed of two  subparts: (1) The bright graph, which is composed  of information that has been manually mapped and integrated with other large databases or used in a publication. This information is integrated with the  current sum of digital human knowledge. It can be considered actual. (2) The  dark graph, which is composed of information extracted automatically from (massive) documentation which has to this point been used in a stand alone fashion as individual historic items. It can be considered virtual. |                    RFC on Data Lifecycle                     |
| Planned 2021 |                        RFC for TM APIs                        | Algorithms and software integrated into the Time Machine must be able to communicate with each  other, thus a definition of joint APIs is required. It is likely that TM Services will be built on top of REST interfaces. In order to meet TM’s needs, these will have to be adapted towards use in large-scale machine  learning. A probable addition is the option to provide the gradient information of a specific module that is integrated using the API, for example. This way remote services can also be integrated into large-scale training processes. |                    RFC on Operation Graph                    |
| Planned 2021 |  RFC for Classification and  Planning of Languages to Address | Defintion of Time Machine's multilingual strategy. This RFC impacts the exploitation platforms, as the TM  will handle documents in multiple European languages and dialects. Some of these languages might be more complicated to address than others due to pre-existing tools for modern variants or availability of materials. A working plan for natural language processing (NLP) tool development should be conceived by taking into consideration the materials, the locations of the LTMs and the Digitisation Hubs, and the features of the languages. |                     RFC on TM Data Graph                     |
| Planned 2021 |                       RFC on Annotation                       | Definition of the annotation  protocols used for the documenting of TM Data Graph. This RFC will be used by exploitation platforms |                     RFC on TM Data Graph                     |
| Planned 2021 |   RFC on Digital Content Processor Development and Testing   | Digital Content Processors (DCP) are automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video,  sound, etc.) As such, the following pipeline may be envisioned: (1) Development of a DCP in a dedicated “Sandbox” (a place where trial and error tests can be undertaken without compromising the entire functioning of the Time Machine architecture). Training will be done on existing labelled documents. (2) Submission of the DCP to the Time Machine Organisation's dedicated service. (3) After some benchmark and assessments of performance, resulting in acceptance or rejection, the suitable DCP becomes an Official TM Component. | RFC on General Standards for the  Super Computing Architecture , RFC on TM API |
| Planned 2021 |       RFC on Digital Content Processor (DCP) of Level 1      | DCP are automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video, sound, etc.) DCP of Level 1 only label mentions of entities. Each processing is fully traceable and reversible, and the results of the processing make up the core dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated into the TM Data Graph. The document should define: (a) The technical conditions for implementing DCP that can be inserted in the Time Machine Operation Graph. (b) The requirements for hosting DCP in the TM Super Computing Infrastructure. The process by which DCP are developed, tested, labelled, published and put in operation | RFC of Data Graph, RFC on  Digital Content Processor Development and Testing |
| Planned 2021 |       RFC on Digital Content Processor (DCP) of Level 2      | DCP are automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video,  sound, etc.) DCP of Level 2 label relations between entities. Each processing is fully traceable and reversible, and the results of the processing make up the core dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated into the TM Data Graph. The document should define: (a) The technical conditions for implementing DCP that can be inserted in the Time Machine  Operation Graph. (b) The requirements for hosting DCP in the TM Super Computing Infrastructure. The process by which DCP are developed, tested, labelled, published and put in operation |      RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 1      |
| Planned 2021 |       RFC on Digital Content Processor (DCP) of Level 3      | DCP are automatic processes for extracting information from documents (images, video,  sound, etc.) DCP of Level 3 label rules. Each processing is fully traceable and reversible, and the results of the processing constitute the core dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated in the TM  Data Graph. The document should define: (a) The technical conditions for implementing DCP that can be inserted in the Time  Machine Operation Graph. (b) The requirements for  hosting DCP in the TM Super Computing Infrastructure. The process by which DCP are developed, tested, labelled, published and put in operation |      RFC on Digital Content Processor  (DCP) of Level 2      |
| Planned 2021 |  RFC on Synergy and interaction in EU Research Infrastructure | The TM digitisation network will build upon existing EU Research Infrastructures (DARIAH, CLARIN) and infrastructure providing access to Cultural Heritage (Europeana, Archive Portal Europe,  etc.) TM will introduce new processing pipelines for transforming and integrating Cultural Heritage data into such infrastructures. |                                                              |
| Planned 2021 |  RFC on General Standards for the Super Computing Architecture | This document will define the general rules that the TM Network partners must follow to integrate their computing resources into the TM Super Computing Architecture and the routing processes managing the data pipelines. In particular, this document will define: (a) The hardware and software standards that the computing resources will follow across the entire distributed Super Computing Architecture. (b) The routing protocols of the TM Operation Graphs. (c) The processes for naming and renewing the administrators of the administrators (d) The  role of the TMO for managing of infrastructure. | RFC on Operation Graph, RFC on  Data Graph, RFC on Synergy and interaction in EU Research Infrastructure |
| Planned 2021 |                    RFC on Time Machine Box                    | Also meant to cover storage  needs for data, the TM Box should help partners involved in a data acquisition, sharing or publishing process to conform to the metadata specifications and  delivery – harvesting protocols as stated by the data model. One of its goals is to smoothen the process of and contribute to the automatisation of the digitisation process (offering for instance a way of monitoring the digitisation tasks). This hardware is part of the Time Machine Official Components. The RFC will define how the production of the Time Machine Box should be managed in the long-term |                    RFC on Operation Graph                    |
| Planned 2021 |                    RFC Digitisation Hubs                     | Defining the functioning and business model for the Digitsation Hubs. In order for the Digitisation Hubs to  be implemented, standards in terms of resolution, file formats and metadata  during acquisition need to be defined beforehand (RFC on Technical Charts). These standards must be consensual and simple in order to ensure easy implemention and fit into existing practices. The RFC must also evaluate relevant technologies and recommend affordable technologies that do not damage the objects, while also providing the best possible results at the same time. Time Machine aims to distribute affordable technology on a large scale using, for example, open design hardware. More costly and dedicated scanning solutions ,such as scan robots and tomographic methods, should be made available in specialised centres spread across the European Union such that their services are available to a maximum number of users. The objective of achieving affordable and wide-spread digitisation should be a priority in this RFC. |        RFC on Open Hardware, RFC on Time Machine Box        |
| Planned 2022 |                RFC for Named Entity Recognition               | This RFC defines named entity recognition for older European languages and variants. The results of the tagging of entities will feed the Dark Data Graph with new information. | RFC for Classification and Planning of Languages to Address , RFC on Digital Content Processor (DCP) of Level 1 |
| Planned 2022 |        RFC on Text Recognition and Processing Pipeline       | This RFC defines the general architecture for this particular kind of media. It must be aligned with the LTM central services. |    RFC on Digital Content Processor (DCP) of Level 1 2 3    |

| Planned 2023 |               RFC on Enhancing Collaboration                | Investigating how to support partnerships across Time Machine member networks (e.g. Europeana,  Icarus) or external cultural-heritage networks. The reflection should focus on a number of different aspects: how to enhance collaboration internally and externally, both at the level of the LTM and the TMO (e.g. with other LTM or partner networks); how to enhance exchange of best practices; how to share content and enhance collaboration between already existing cultural heritage networks and associations |                          RFC on LTM                          |
| Planned 2023 |                    RFC on Franchise System                    | A franchise model clarifying the financial relationship between LTMs and the TMO’s services will be put in place, in accordance with the financial needs and costs of Time Machine's technical and coordination infrastructures. The franchise system must be scalable and adaptable, as the network will grow along with its reputation in the public eye and the financial benefit generated for LTMs. The franchise system is meant to be complementary to that which is established for the TMO partners. To enter a LTM, an institution should at minimum be required to become a member of the TMO. One of the subtasks of this RFC is to also assess and to further design the role of the TMO as a “Financial, Economic, Intelligence and Watch services office. |                          RFC on LTM                          |

| Planned 2023 |                    RFC on Distributed Storage                  | The TM distributed storage system will target offering an alternative solution to current HTTP-based storage. While in a first phase, most documents and data will be stored on specific servers accessible through standard protocols (e.g. images on IIIF servers), the aim of the project is to develop a storage solution that would have the following objectives: (1) Giving access to high volume of data with high efficiency, (2) Optimising storage to store more data, (3) Implementing long-term preservation of data, preventing accidental or deliberate deletion and keeping a fully versioned history of the data stored, (4) Guaranteeing authenticity of the data stored and preventing the inclusion of fake sources. | RFC on Data Graph, RFC on Operation Graph, RFC on Synergy and Interaction in EU Research Infrastructure, RFC on Time Machine Box |
| Planned 2023 |        RFC on Distributed storage System for Public Data      | This document will define the infrastructure principles for a decentralized solution of public datasets based on Creative Commons licences like CC-0, CC-BY, CC-BY-NC and the Europeana rights declarations. Storage will be maintained for the resources shared by the partners of the TM Infrastructure Alliance. A distributed system like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and the work done by the IPFS Consortium for persistence of IPFS objects may be a good starting point, as such types of file systems do not identify a resource by its location but by a unique identification number. Routing algorithms optimised through P2P algorithms are the most efficient ways to bring the data to the visualisation or computing processes. This also speeds up the process when the host is a region with low connectivity. It is critical that redundancy and long-term resilience can be guaranteed, which means that the system must be designed to make any public data content that it stores undeletable in practice. In turn, this will make it difficult to censor content, and for this reason it is especially well adapted for public data associated with creative common licenses. Systems like IPFS also provide the possibility for each node of the network to choose the categories of data they accept to replicate. This provides some flexibility in the negotiation of a common strategy by the Time Machine  Infrastructure Alliance. To ensure the authenticity of the data stored, a blockchain type solution could be the solution. The interaction between the distributed file system and the authentication solution will be defined by the RFC. |                  RFC on Distributed Storage                 
| Planned 2023 |      RFC on Distributed Storage System for Private Data      | Private datasets could be stored in either: (1) A specific layer of the distributed storage system, provided reliable cryptographic and authentication systems are in place, (2) A “fenced” location offered by partners of the Time Machine Network as storage solution. In both cases, the RFC should define how such closed datasets could use Time Machine infrastructure services and under which conditions. |                  RFC on Distributed Storage                  |
| Planned 2023 |                 RFC on On-demand Digitisation                 | This RFC defines the process for on-demand digitisation, enabling any user to request the digitisation of a specific document. An alignment with the archival description system will be necessary. |             RFC on Data Graph, RFC on Operation Graph             |
| Planned 2023 |     RFC on Global Optimization of Digitisation Process      | Definition of the strategy for optimising the digitisation processes.

| Planned 2023 |              RFC for Orthographic  Normalisation              | This RFC defines the orthographic normalisation of older European language variants. The results will improve the search functionality of the databases. | RFC for classification and  planning of languages to address |
| Planned 2023 |                   RFC on Content Filtering                   | Content filtering may be  necessary to control the exposure of users of Time Machine services to unsolicited content. Finding the right technologies which allow such controls without enabling the possibly of abusive censorship operations will be the challenge of this RFC. |          RFC on Vision Mission and Values  Charter           |
| Planned 2024 |                  RFC on Knowledge Transfer                   | Investigating how to support achievements and knowledge transfer inside the TM network, ensuring a global research collaboration at a European scale. There are only rare examples of large-scale research data management models, dealing with similar complexity levels as the TM; however, some guidelines can be found such as: “Guidance Document Presenting a Framework for Discipline-specific Research Data Management” (Science Europe, January 2018), “Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management” (Science Europe, November 2018). |               RFC on Enhancing  Collaboration                |

| Planned 2024 |             RFC on Large-Scale Inference Engine             | The Large-Scale Inference Engine is capable of inferring the consequences of chaining any information in the database. This enables Time Machine to induce new logical consequences of existing data. The Large-Scale Inference Engine is used to shape and to assess the coherence of the 4D simulations based on human-understandable concepts and constraints. Its origin derives from more traditional logic-based AI technology, slightly overlooked since the recent success of the deep learning architecture, that can, nevertheless, play a key role in an initiative like TM. This document will specify the various types of rules that the Large-Scale Inference Engine can process including: rules extracted from documents by DCP, implicit  rules made explicit, and rules (statistical or not) induced from the data. The document should define: the process by which rules are submitted, tested and integrated in the engine, and the processes for managing conflicting rules or results from various rules. The document will also motivate implementation of solutions in relation with existing deployed systems like Wolfram Alpha or IBM  Watson and standards like OWL, SKOS. |      RFC on Digital Content Processor (DCP) of Level 3      |
| Planned 2024 |                       RFC on the 4D Grid                      | Through a hierarchical division  of space (3D) and time, the system organises a multi-resolution 4D grid which serves as a general spatiotemporal index. Each “cube” in the grid indexes all the information relevant for these particular spatiotemporal elements. It  offers an efficient perspective for organising large datasets and  performing collective curation through manual and automatic processes. Each element of the grid will also potentially be labelled according to other various multidimensional criteria, some of them being AI-based descriptors (e.g. descriptors for architectural style detection in images). |                      RFC on Data Graph                       |
| Planned 2024 |                     RFC on 4D Simulations                     | The 4D grid is sparse, as there are many places/times in the world that are not directly associated with existing archival data. A central research challenge is to develop AI systems capable  of extending the information of the data grid in space and time through continuous extrapolation and interpolation, and developing new ways of visualising which parts of the content are anchored in sourced data, simulated or unknown.  Extensions of current deep-learning generative methods, originally developed  for 2D imaging, can be envisioned to deal with the richness of the 4D  datasets. Many 4D simulations can be associated with the same 4D grid, and one central challenge is to manage this multiplicity of worlds and their specific resolution levels for various services of the Time Machine (e.g. entertainment, policy planning). |                      RFC on the 4D Grid                      |
| Planned 2024 |               RFC TM Tools for History Research              | To engage researchers in social  sciences and humanities is to productively use the Big Data of the Past, and the TM can offer researchers a series of tools that facilitate analyses.  These tools will be enhanced by the Digital Content Processor and the Simulation Engines, which will enable scholars to work with historical data in an  unprecedented way. | RFC on 4D Simulations, RFC on  Large-Scale Inference Engine  |
| Planned 2024 |               RFC on New Scanning Technology                | Cutting-edge technologies, such as automatic scanning machines with low human supervision, scanning robots and solutions for scanning films and books without the need to unroll/open them, should be considered and fostered by the TM. A specific scheme to incentivise these technologies will be created. The goal is to reach an appropriate mix of dedicated specialized scanning centres and aid the development of mobile special use hardware, e.g. mobile CT scanners that are mounted on trucks. |       RFC on Open Hardware, RFC on Digitisation Hubs        |
| Planned 2025 |                      RFC on 4D Simulator                      | The 4D Simulator manages a continuous spatiotemporal simulation of all possible pasts and futures that are compatible with the data. The 4D Simulator includes a multiscale hierarchical architecture for dividing space and time into discrete volumes with a unique identifier: a simulation engine for producing new datasets based on the information stored. Each possible spatiotemporal multiscale simulation corresponds to a multidimensional representation in the 4D computing infrastructure. When sufficient  spatiotemporal density of data is reached, it can produce a 3D representation of the place at a chosen moment in European history. In navigating the representation space, one can also navigate in alternative past and future  simulations. Uncertainty and incoherence are managed at each stage of the process and directly associated with the corresponding reconstructions of the past and the future. The document should specify the interaction of the 4D simulator with the rest of the architecture, answering questions like: How can an entity of the TM Data Graph be associated with a particular element of the 4D Grid?, How can 4D simulations be run and cached for future  use?, How can the system be used directly in exploitation platforms? |                  RFC on the 4D Simulations                   |
| Planned 2025 |            RFC on Universal Representation Engine            | The Universal Representation Engine manages a multidimensional representation of a space resulting from the integration of a pattern of extremely diverse types of digital cultural  artefacts (text, images, videos, 3D and time) and permitting new types of data generation based on transmodal pattern understanding. In such a space, the surface structure of any complex cultural artefact, landscape or situation is seen as a point in a multidimensional vector space. On this basis, it could generate a statue or a building or produce a piece of music or a painting, based only on its description, geographical origins and age. The document will specify the integration of the URE in the global architecture, outlining  for example how a given node in the TM Data Graph can be associated with a parametric representation space. |                       RFC for TM APIs                        |
