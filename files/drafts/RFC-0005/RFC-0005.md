# RFC-0005: RFC on LTM

## Motivation



## Projects



## Services to LTM

### Digitisation Hubs

The Digitisation Hubs are an example of service that will be offered to Local Time Machines  for digitisation (e.g. scanning of documents, streets, 3D scanning). 

The Digitisation Hubs will enable to seamlessly aggregated new document and metadata into a Time Machine Data Graph, with the appropriate standards in terms of resolution, file formats, and metadata during acquisition. Contractual aspects will be dealt with the Time Machine Standard Contracts. 

The Structure and detailed functioning of the Digitisation Hubs are planned to be developed first as an RFC specifying their structure then implemented as a Service operated by several operators. As planned in the RFC Tree and roadmaps, The RFC on Digitisation Hubs is planned on Y2 and their first implementation on Y3 and Y4. It will be established directly with actors that may become Service operators. 

What is anticipated are the following steps :
a) Declaration of the digitisation Services on timemachine.eu
b) Specification of its Zone of Coverage. The Zone of Coverage will determine the Local Time Machines in which the Services will be publicized. 
c) Precise definition of digitisation offers using only Standard Metrics in order to be able to determine the exact price of the operations 
d) Once the service are ready, direct transaction on the Timemachine.eu platform

This way of functioning should enable to create a well-functioning single European market for digitisation services connecting operators and costumers using agreed standards.
