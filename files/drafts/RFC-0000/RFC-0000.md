## Solution

###Â Review Process

Figure X explains the RFC process

(Insert Schema)

- The RFC Editorial Committee appoints authors to Write RFC planned in the RFC tree. Or alternatively authors contact the RFC Editorial Committee to candidate to write a RFC (planned in the RFC tree or not)
- The authors produces a RFC draft which is reviewed first by the RFC Editorial Committee for coherence with the rest of the RFC corpus and then by a larger community. The RFC is revised and possibly re reviewed. 
- Once accepted by the RFC Editorial Committee it receives an official identifier and is published official as an authored peer-reviewed publications 
- The RFC tree is adapted with the published RFC and possible sub-RFC planned in the writing of the new RFC.

The detals of the implemtenation and Editrial Committee are given on two others RFCs.
