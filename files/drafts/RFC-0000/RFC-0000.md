# RFC-0000: RFC on RFCs

## Motivation

Reaching consensus on the technology options to follow in a programme as large as Time Machine is a complex issue. To ensure the open development and evaluation of work, a process inspired by the Request for Comments (RFC) that was used for the development of the Internet protocol is adapted to the needs of Time Machine. Time Machine Requests for Comments are freely accessible publications, identified with a unique ID, constituting the main process for establishing rules, recommendations, core architectural choices for the Time Machine components.

## Approach

The Time Machine RFC are based on the following principles 

1. Accessibility.  **RFC** are freely accessible, free of charge. 
2. Openness. Anybody can write a **RFC**.
3. Identification.  Each **RFC**, once published, has a unique ID and version number. 
4. Incrementalism.  Each **RFC** should be useful for its own right and act as a building block to others. Each **RFC** must be aimed as a contribution, extension or revision of the Time Machine Infrastructure. 
5. Standardisation. **RFC** should aim to make use of standardised terms to improve the clarity level of its recommendation. 
6. Scope. **RFCs** are designed contribution and implementation solutions solving practical problems. **RFC** are not research papers and may not necessarily contain experimental evidence. 
7. Self-defining process. Like for the development of the Internet, **RFC** are the main process for establishing the Time Machine Infrastructure and Processes  but also the processes and roles for managing **RFCs** themselves.

## RFC Publication Process

1. The RFC Editorial Committee appoints authors to Write RFC planned in the **RFC tree** (RFC-0002). Alternatively authors contact the **RFC Editorial Committee** to candidate to write a RFC (planned in the **RFC tree**  or not)
2. The authors produce a RFC draft which is reviewed first by the **RFC Editorial Committee**  for coherence with the rest of the RFC corpus and then by a larger community. The RFC is revised and possibly re reviewed. 
3. Once accepted by the **RFC Editorial Committee** , it receives an official identifier and is published official as an authored peer-reviewed publications 
4. The **RFC tree** is adapted with the published RFC and possible sub-RFC planned in the writing of the new RFC.

## RFC Format

The RFC Format and Guidelines are estabished iteratively by the **RFC Editorial Committee**. The most-up-to-date version is features in the **RFC-0000**.

Current Format
1. Motivation section
2. Series of sections describing the Approach and Solution 
3. Question and Answers section
4. Linked RFCs section

## Question and Answers 

### What are the main differences between TM RFC and Internet Society RFC ?

The Time Machine RFC are developed more than 50 years after the RFCs that shaped in the Internet. The main differences are the following :
1. Time Machine RFCs are exclusively used to describe motivated solutions and not general communication
2. Time Machine RFCs can be revised and are redefined iteratively, wheraeas significant improvement on the Internet Society RFC lead to the creation of new RFC. 

## Linked RFCs

* The **RFC Tree** is kept up to date in the **RFC-0002**
* The governance and functionning of the **RFC Editorial Committee** is defined in **RFC-0003**
* The detail of the RFC platform is defined in the **RFC-0004**
