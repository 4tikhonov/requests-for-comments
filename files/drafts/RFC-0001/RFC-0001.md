# RFC-0001:  Time Machine Glossary

## Motivation

The Time Machine Glossary is meant to have clear definition of the term used in the RFC and throughout the other Time Machine document. It should be updated regularly based on the introduction of new RFC. 

When writing RFCs, terms that are part of the Lexicon should be written using a clearly identifiable syntax. The current suggestion is do write them with a Capital and in **Bold**

## Glossary

### 4D Map

The **4D Map** is a central element of the Time Machine to locate resources, services and reconstructions.The **4D map** is both the map where activities can be followed and the map that aggregate results.  It plots in particular **Local Time Machines**. The density of the 4D Maps is not uniform. In particular some zones may be modelled only in 3D, 2D and even 1D, as a list of included elements. 

### 4D Simulator 

The **4D Simulator** is one of the Time Machine **Engines**. The **4D Simulator** manages a continuous spatiotemporal simulation of all possible pasts and futures that are compatible with the data. The **4D Simulator** includes a multiscale hierarchical architecture for dividing space and time into discrete volumes with a unique identifier: a simulation engine for producing new datasets based on the information stored. Each possible spatiotemporal multiscale simulation corresponds to a multidimensional representation in the 4D computing infrastructure. When a sufficient spatiotemporal density of data is reached, it can produce a 3D representation of the place at a chosen moment in History. In navigating the representation space, one can also navigate in alternative past and future simulations. Uncertainty and incoherence are managed at each stage of the process and directly associated with the corresponding reconstructions of the past and the future. 

### Annotators

**Annotators** are dedicated **Apps** for annotating images and documents 

###  App

Application (Web-based or not) that performs operations on **Components**. **Apps** can be developed by **Time Machine Organisation** or by third parties. The **Apps** are pieces of software (in general built as part of official  **Projects** but not necessarily) that permits to experience and edit the information in the **Data Graph** and the **4D Map**. They can be grouped into families of **Apps** like the **Navigators** or the **Annotators**.


### Big Data of the Past

**Big Data of the Past** are a huge distributed digital information system mapping social, cultural and geographical evolution. A key objective of Time Machine is that such a system brings together dense, interoperable, standardised (linked data, preferably open) and localised (marked up with spatial-temporal information) social, cultural and geographical heritage resources. 

###  Code Library

The **Code Library** is a library accessible in Python (and possibly later other languages) regrouping key **Operators** function for processing Data in the Time Machine Environment. 

###  Component 

A **Component** of the Time Machine is itself a Machine in the sense of systems reacting in a predictable manner to input given an internal State. Each component can react or be acted upon through a defined set of Inputs / Operations. Some of these operations can be internal, others can be external. Internal Operations change the internal structure or state of the Machine and therefore update its history. External Operations change characterises the usage of a **Component**, producing an external Output based  of the current State of the Machine. Sequence of consecutive states that permits to reconstruct the current state of the component. 

### Conflict Detectors

**Conflict Detectors** are **Apps** that detects incoherence in the **Data Graph** and help users solve them. 

###  Data Graph

The **Data Graph** is a formal representation of knowledge extracted by human or automatic process, represented with semantic web technology.

###  Data Synchronisation

**Data Synchronisation** automatically compares data documented by a project with conflicting data from another project or an inference. 

### Digital Content Processor

A **Digital Content Processor** is an automatic process extracting information from documents (images, video, sound, etc.). Level 1 Digital Content Processor labels mentions of entities. Level 2 Digital Content Processor labels relations between entities. The Digital Content Processor of Level 3 labels rules. Each process is fully traceable and reversible. The results of the processing constitute the core dataset of the **Big Data of the Past** and are integrated in the **Data Graph**. 

### Digitisation Hubs

**Digitisation Hubs** are an example of a **Service to Local Time Machines**  for digitisation (e.g. scanning of documents, streets, 3D scanning). Contractual aspects are dealt with the **Standard Contracts**. So far, Europe has failed to organise in an efficient way the market of digitisation effort in terms of standard and pricing. Time Machine can offer a new approach to this issue. The Digitisation Hubs will enable to seamlessly aggregated new document and metadata into a **Data Graph**, with the appropriate standards in terms of resolution, file formats, and metadata during acquisition. As service it can be associated with a **Zone of Coverage** and will use **Standard Metrics** to be able to determine the exact price of the operations. This way of functioning should enable to create a well-functioning single European market for digitisation services connecting operators and customers using agreed standards. 

### Engine

An **Engine** acts on the **Data Graph** to enrich it. Examples of Engines include : The **4D Simulator**, The **Large-Scale Inference Engine** and the **Universal Representation Engine**.

### Frontier year

The **Frontier year** is the oldest year in the past for which the information skeleton of the **Place** for which the **Information Skeleton** is established. 

### GeoEntities

**GeoEntities** are existing geographical entities (e.g. a list of Places documented in Open Street Map (OSM)) defined as standard Geographical Information System objects (points - lines - polygons).

### Importers 

**Importers** are **Apps** that permit to link existing datasets to the **Data Graph**. Examples : IIIF Source Importer, Collection creator.  Geographical Layer Importer (e.g. Geojsn importer), Datatable importer (e.g. CSV), Cadastral Parcels Importer, Cloud point Importer, Spherical Image Importer, 3D Model Importer ...

### Information Skeleton

The **information Sketelon** contains the core information of the **Data Graph**. It should be reconstructed first. 

### Large-Scale Inference Engine

The **Large-Scale Inference Engine** is one of the Time Machine **Engines**. The **Large-Scale Inference Engine** is capable of inferring the consequences of chaining any information in the database. This permits to induce new logical consequences of existing data. It is used to shape and to assess the coherence of the 4D simulations based on human-understandable concepts and constraints. Its origin lies in more traditional logic-based AI technology, which has been slightly overlooked since the recent success of the deep learning architecture, but that can, nevertheless, play a key role in an initiative like TM. 

### Local Datasets

**Local Datasets** are produced and published about a particular place. Published Datasets are Open Acces. They have authors and could be derived from other datasets. The history of their production must be documented. They cannot be unpublished.  They appear in in the **Local Time Machine Webspace**


### Local Time Machine

**Local Time Machines** are zones of higher “rebuilding the past activities” density, made of **Projects** active in this particular area.  Local Time Machines focus on **Municipalities**. A **Local Time Machine** is defined as the activities and results of the **Projects** concerning a **Municipality**. The **Local Time Webspace** features the information of all the **Projects** linked with the **Municipality** corresponding to the **Local Time Machine**. The **Local Time Machine Visual Plan** is an automatically generated representation of a spatiotemporal focus of the different projects participating to a **Local Time Machine**.  The **Local Time Machine Datasets** are extracted datasets that can be freely downloaded, even if they are not yet integrated with the global **Data Graph**.  The **Local Time Machine Operations** are the list of basic operations produced by **Projects** and concerning particular **GeoEntitites**. They appear as a log of activities in the **Local Time Machines Webspace**.  The **Local Time Machine Density of Operations** characterises the number of activities going on in the **Local Time Machine**. It characterises both the activities that are going on inside **Projects** and for Citizen Scientist activities. Standards values of activities define a scale to represent Local Time Machine (**RFC on LTM Value Scale**, planned 2020). The **Local Time Machine Community** is the list of active users of a **Local Time Machine** . These include users active in **Projects** and users active in crowdsourcing activities (e.g. transcription, correction, training, etc.). By default, the active users may get updated about announcement concerning **Local Time Machine Activities**

### Local Time Machine Activities

**Local Time Machine Activities** are declared Activities (e.g. events, training session) by participants of **Projects** of a **Local Time Machine**

### Local Time Machine Webspace

The **Local Time Machine Webspace** is dedicated to each **Local Time Machine** on the **Time Machine Website**. It includes the information about the **Local TIme Machine Activities** and **Services to Local Time Machines** and the **Local Datasets**

### Long-term Preservation Service

**Long-term Preservation Services** are offered by some operators for the long-term preservation of particular datasets (e.g. IIIF repository). Some of these services may include innovative technology like DNA storage. 

### Memory Store

Each document, artefact or building is a **Memory Store**, a kind of "hard drive" from the past. The Tools for the Local Time Machine are extraction tools to redocument the content of these memory stores into the **Data Graph**. 

### Metadata Generation

A major aim in Time Machine is the automatic generation of metadata using methods of pattern recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Such automated extraction methods are already being explored for hand-written text recognition and entity extraction. Yet this is only a first step, as today’s systems fail in identifying e.g. text in complex 2-D scenes such as paintings and maps and on 3-D objects such as vases and sculptures. Significant amounts of metadata that are currently created by curators in museums and archives could, however, be generated automatically such as classification of materials, object sizes, as well as linking to other public data sources such as wiki data given appropriate digitisation workflows and sensors. Doing so, Time Machine aims at creating a new dimension of accessibility in digital history and cultural heritage. By indexing the objects by their content, it will also be possible to link collection items at large scale, thus providing the capability of propagating metadata through these connexions. In the current design, this help for metadatation will be provided through **Time Machine Tools and API**. This will enable to combine the automatic suggestion of metadata with expert curation. 

### Municipalities

**Municipalities** are zones of territories dividing the surface of earth on administratively non-ambiguous zones. The list of **Municipalities** is therefore the potential Local Time Machine is fixed and predetermined. It fixes the granularity of the **Local Time Machines**. 


### Navigators 

**Navigators** are the equivalent of Browsers on the World Wide Web. They interpret the **Data Graph** and the **4D Map** to create different processes for exploration. Various typologies of Navigators can be designed : Search Engines, Collection Browsers. 4D Browser (web-based or application-based for better performances). Data Graph Inspector / Editor. Pattern finder / navigators, Genealogical Explorer, etc. 

### Operator

**Operators** are functions in the **Code Library**. They can be chained in a procedural way. 


### Place

A **Place** is an identified container in which activities can occur (take place). A **Place** corresponds to particular extent in space, usually determined in reference to another place. A place can be contained in other **Place** and can contain other **Places**.**Places** are symbolic entity in which temporarily extended processes can occur. A **Place** may not be determined by geographical coordinate. Some moving entities are places (e.g. a car, a plane, a ship). 

### Project

A **Project** produces data for a particular **GeoEntity** or several **GeoEntities**.  Projects are usually conducted by institutions but can also be launched by individuals. Projects may be new or redocumentation of ancient projects. Projects can mine **Sources** and ingest their extracted data into the **Data Graph**. These **Projects** are associated with a **Zone of Coverage** that associated them with **Local Time Machines**, producing content for  **GeoEntitites**. A **Project** may also produce intermediary datasets that can be downloaded even if they are not yet integrated in the **Data Graph**.  Projects can also develop **Apps** that interact with the **4D Map** and the **Data Graph**. **Projects** can contribute to the **Code Library** by working on the GitHub repository of the Time Machine to produce new **Operators**. These different objectives are non-exclusive from one another. The **Project Development Space** is a space in the **Time Machine Website** that features the **Apps** relevant to develop the **Projects**. 

###  Project Repository

The **Project Repository** monitors all the active projects of the Time Machine.

### Retrochronological approach

The **Retrochronological approach** consists of starting from the present and going back to the past, retroprogating through **Transfer** the presicion of the present 

### Scouting Projects

**Projects** beyond the **Frontier year**


### Segmenters

**Segmenters** are **Operators** that can be used for segmenting Objects and Persons in images, Parcels in Cadastral Maps, perform  Document Layout analysis or 3D Object segmentation. 

### Service to Local Time Machines

Services offered to **Local Time Machines** appearing as **Apps** activefor some **Local Time Machines** and using **Standard Contracts**. Services typically appear in the **Local Time Machine WebSpace**. Examples include **Digitisation Hubs**, **Time Machine Box**, **Long-term preservation Service**

### Spatio-temporal Anchoring

The objective of Time Machine, is to localise cultural objects in Space and Time. For instance, an object in a museum can be associated with several spatio-temporal references: its place of production, the various places it was stored before entering the Museum, the spatio-temporal entity it represents. One consequence is that a museum in Paris may contribute to many **Local Time Machines** in the world, having for instance paintings representing Venice, Madrid or Budapest. Inversely, in many cases, the evidence of reconstructing the past of a city or a site is scattered in collections all over the world. The granularity of such spatio-temporal repositioning can be more or less precise or more or less uncertain. To be ingested in the **Data Graph**, the museum will create a dedicated project whose goal is to produce the spatio-temporal anchoring of some of its collections in a way or another and document the process by which this repositioning has been done. In many cases, this work has already been done by the curator or researchers of the Museums and the goal is thus only to redocument this work in the Time Machine framework. In other cases dedicated projects must be conducted. 

### Sources

**Sources** contain information to be extracted (mined). One typically distinguish primary sources (e.g. archival records) from secondary sources (e.g. academic article). 

### Standard Contracts

**Standard Contracts** are sets of standard contracts to facilitate the interaction between Time Machine partners, for instance for the **Digitisation Hubs**

### Time Machine API

The **Time Machine API** offers to **Projects** to enter their data in the **Data Graph**

### Time Machine Box

**Time Machine Boxes** allow partners to store their documents and metadata and to integrate the **Time Machine Network** easily and be appropriately documented in the **Data Graph**. The Time Machine Box is part of the **Time Machine Official Components**. 

### Time Machine CSA

Project with 33 partners supported by European Commission during the years 2019-2020 to produce a 10-year roadmap for the Time Machine project. All deliverable and roadmaps, once validated by the European Commission are available publically.  

###  Time Machine Community

All users registered in the Time Machine Website. Each user Time Machine ID can be used to login in third parties **Apps**,  depending on their level of activity, users may reach different status linked with particular privileges in terms of operations. These statuses are organised taking inspiration from the Wikipedia systems of privilege (e.g. Administrator, Stewards, etc.).


### Time Machine Index

The TM index is a global system indexing different types of objects: e.g. documents; iconography; 3D geometries. It gathers all information regarding documents and their contents and could be used as a basis for other search engine infrastructure.
