# RFC-0001:  Time Machine Glossary

## Motivation

The Time Machine Glossary is meant to have clear definition of the term used in the RFC and throughout the other Time Machine document. It should be updated regularly based on the introduction of new RFC. 

When writing RFCs, terms that are part of the Lexicon should be written using an clearly identifiable syntax. The current suggestion is do write them with a Capital and in **Bold**

## Glossary

### 4D Map

Central element of the Time Machine to locate resources, services and reconstructions.The 4D map is both the map where activities can be followed and the map that aggregates results.  It plots in particular **Local Time Machines** put also the  **Local Datasets** they made avaiable. The density of the 4D Maps is not uniform. In particular some zones may be modelled only in 3D, 2D and even 1D, as a list of included elements. 

### 4D Simulator 

One of the Time Machine **Engines**. The 4D Simulator manages a continuous spatiotemporal simulation of all possible pasts and futures that are compatible with the data. The 4D Simulator includes a multiscale hierarchical architecture for dividing space and time into discrete volumes with a unique identifier: a simulation engine for producing new datasets based on the information stored. Each possible spatiotemporal multiscale simulation corresponds to a multidimensional representation in the 4D computing infrastructure. When a sufficient spatiotemporal density of data is reached, it can produce a 3D representation of the place at a chosen moment in History. In navigating the representation space, one can also navigate in alternative past and future simulations. Uncertainty and incoherence are managed at each stage of the process and directly associated with the corresponding reconstructions of the past and the future. 

### Big Data of the Past

A huge distributed digital information system mapping social, cultural and geographical evolution. A key objective of Time Machine is that such a system brings together dense, interoperable, standardised (linked data, preferably open) and localised (marked up with spatial-temporal information) social, cultural and geographical heritage resources. 

###  Data Graph

Formal representation of knowledge extracted by human or automatic process, represented with semantic web technology.

###  Data Synchronisation

Automatically compares data documented by a project with conflicting data from another project or an inference. 

### Digital Content Processor

Automatic process extracting information from documents (images, video, sound, etc.). Level 1 Digital Content Processor labels mentions of entities. Level 2 Digital Content Processor labels relations between entities. The Digital Content Processor of Level 3 labels rules. Each process is fully traceable and reversible. The results of the processing constitute the core dataset of the Big Data of the Past and are integrated in the **Data Graph**. 

### Digitisation Hubs

Example of a **Service to Local Time Machines**  for digitisation (e.g. scanning of documents, streets, 3D scanning). Contractual aspects are dealt with the **Standard Contracts**

So far, Europe has failed to organise in an efficient way the market of digitisation effort in terms of standard and pricing. Time Machine can offer a new approach to this issue. The Digitisation Hubs will enable to seamlessly aggregated new document and metadata into a **Data Graph**, with the appropriate standards in terms of resolution, file formats, and metadata during acquisition. As service is will be associated with a **Zone of Coverage** and will use **Standard Metrics** to be able to determine the exact price of the operations. This way of functioning should enable to create a well-functioning single European market for digitisation services connecting operators and customers using agreed standards. 

Corresponding RFC: The Structure and detailed functioning of the Digitisation Hubs are planned to be developed first as an RFC specifying their structure then implemented as a Service operated by several operators. As planned in the RFC Tree and roadmaps, The RFC on Digitisation Hubs is planned on Y2 and their first implementation on Y3 and Y4. It will be established directly with actors that may become Service operators. 

### Engine

Systems that act on the **Data Graph** to enrich it. Examples of Engines include : The **4D Simulator**, The **Large-Scale Inference Engine** and the **Universal Representation Engine**

### Frontier year

Oldest date in the past for which the information skeleton of the **Place** for which the **Information Skeleton** is established. 

### Information Skeleton

The information sketelon contains the core information of the **Data Graph**. It should be reconstructed first. 

### Large-Scale Inference Engine

One of the Time Machine **Engines**. The Large-Scale Inference Engine is capable of inferring the consequences of chaining any information in the database. This permits to induce new logical consequences of existing data. The Engine is used to shape and to assess the coherence of the 4D simulations based on human-understandable concepts and constraints. Its origin lies in more traditional logic-based AI technology, which has been slightly overlooked since the recent success of the deep learning architecture, but that can, nevertheless, play a key role in an initiative like TM. 

### Local Datasets

Datasets produced and published about a particular place. Published Datasets are Open Acces. They have authors and could be derived from other datasets. The history of their production must be documented. They cannot be unpublished.  They appear in in the **Local Time Machine Webspace**


### Local Time Machine

### Local Time Machine Activities

Declared Activites (e.g. events, training session) by participants of **Local Time Machine Projects** 

### Local Time Machine Webspace

Space dedicated to each **Local Time Machine** on the **Time Machine Website**. Include the information about the **Local TIme Machine Activities** and **Services to Local Time Machines** and the **Local Datasets**

### Long-term Preservation Service

Service offered by some operators for the long-term preservation of particular datasets (e.g. IIIF repository). This can for instance include DNA storage. 

### Memory Store

Each document, artefact or building is a memory store, a kind of "hard-drive" from the past. The Tools for the Local Time Machine are extraction tools to redocument the content of these memory stores into the **Data Graph**. 

### Metadata Generation

A major aim in Time Machine is the automatic generation of metadata using methods of pattern recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Such automated extraction methods are already being explored for hand-written text recognition and entity extraction. Yet this is only a first step, as today’s systems fail in identifying e.g. text in complex 2-D scenes such as paintings and maps and on 3-D objects such as vases and sculptures. Significant amounts of metadata that are currently created by curators in museums and archives could, however, be generated automatically such as classification of materials, object sizes, as well as linking to other public data sources such as wiki data given appropriate digitisation workflows and sensors. Doing so, will create a new dimension of accessibility in digital history and cultural heritage. By indexing the objects by their content, it will also be possible to link collection items at large scale, thus providing the capability of propagating metadata through these connexions. In the current design, this help for metadatation will be provided through **Time Machine Tools and API**. This will enable to combine the automatic suggestion of metadata with expert curation. 

### Place

A place is a symbolicaly identifed container in which activities can occur (take place). A Place corresponds to particular extend in space, usually determined in reference with another places. A place can be contained in other Place and can contain other Places. It an symbolic entity in which temporrally-extended processes can occur. A place may not be determined by geographical coordinate. Some moving entities are place (e.g. a car, a plane, a ship).

### Project

A project produces data for a particular **Place** or several **Places**.  Projects are usually conducted by institutions but can also be launched by individual. Projects may be new or redocumentation of ancient projects. 

Projects usually mine **Sources** and ingest their extracted data into the **Data Graph** using the **Time Machine Tools** and **Time Machine API**. 

### Retrochronological order

### Spatio-temporal Anchoring

The objective of Time Machine, is to localize cultural objects in Space and Time. For instance, an object in a museum can be associated with several spatio-temporal references: its place of production, the various places it was stored before entering the Museum, the spatio-temporal entity it represents. One consequence is that a museum in Paris may contribute to many LTMs in the world, having for instance paintings representing Venice, Madrid or Budapest. Inversely, in many cases, the evidence of reconstructing the past of a city or a site is scattered in collections all over the world. 

The granularity of such spatio-temporal repositioning can be more or less precise or more or less uncertain. To be ingested in the **Data Graph**, the Museum will create a dedicated project which goal is to produce the spatio-temporal anchoring of some of its collections in a way or another and document the process by which this repositioning has been done. In many cases, this work has already been done by the curator or researchers of the Museums and the goal is thus only to redocument this work in the Time Machine framework. In other cases dedicated projects must be conducted.
